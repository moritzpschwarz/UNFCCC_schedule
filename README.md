# UNFCCC COP Meeting Schedule Finder

This Shiny app is designed to help participants of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conferences of the Parties (COPs) easily navigate and find the meetings, side events, and press conferences relevant to them. By providing a streamlined, filterable interface, the app allows users to quickly access schedule information without having to sift through the entire event schedule.

## Features

-   **Date Selection**: Choose any date to view scheduled events for that day.

-   **Event Type Filtering**: Filter events by categories such as:

    -   **Official Meetings** (e.g., plenaries and meeting rooms)

    -   **Side Events**

    -   **Press Conferences**

    -   **Coordination Meetings** (e.g., daily coordination meetings for specific groups)

    -   **Uncertain** (for events that do not clearly fall into other categories)

-   **Combined Schedule Data**: The app aggregates information from all available dates, enabling users to view and filter events for the entire conference in one place.

## Motivation

The UNFCCC COPs host numerous events and meetings, often making it challenging for attendees to locate the sessions most relevant to them. This app aims to simplify that process by providing an easy-to-use interface that lets participants filter by date and event type. Whether you're looking for a high-level plenary session, a focused side event, or a coordination meeting for a specific group, this tool can help you find it quickly.

## Instructions

1.  **Select a Date**: Use the dropdown menu to select a specific date you want to view.

2.  **Filter by Event Type**: Choose the event types you are interested in from the checkboxes. You can select multiple types to view a combination of official meetings, side events, press conferences, etc.

3.  **View Results**: The filtered events will display in the main panel, showing you only the relevant meetings and events for your selected filters.

## Known Issues

This app uses scraped data from the UNFCCC Grand Reserva website, and the structure of the website may change without notice, potentially causing issues in data retrieval. Additionally, some events may be categorized as "Uncertain" if they do not match existing filters.
